make it possible to filter out scenarios that use a role
from new printing of base game

pick_game: show how many results are recorded for each scenario

params: replace player_count drop down with four separate
buttons

refactor Result entities to be singleton children of Game entities

PostScenario: should fail if scenario already exists

PostScenario: enforce scenario_id equal SHA-1 hash of scenario data

retrieve_special_event: is broken due to angularization (maybe fixed?)

join_network_game:
  Go Back button doesn't work

watch game: on some pages (e.g. forecast), gives users buttons to
rearrange cards

watch game: can we make a way to simply mirror what the controller
is doing? (e.g. if the controller clicks 'play special event', the
watcher will see the list of special events)

usability: text is a bit smaller than it needs to be on nexus 5/5x
browser

tournament events: always list in alphabetical order

tournament events: allow deleting
