pick_game: show how many results are recorded for each deal

think about handling 2nd edition new roles:
 * Contingency Planner - allows Event cards to be recovered from discard pile
    and played again

 * Quarantine Specialist - does not affect duplicate play

add an Options screen, with
 * an option to substitute Toronto with Montreal (to handle 2nd edition sets)
