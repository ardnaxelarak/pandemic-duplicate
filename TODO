make it possible to filter out scenarios that use a role
from new printing of base game

pick_game: show how many results are recorded for each scenario

params: replace player_count drop down with four separate
buttons

refactor Result entities to be singleton children of Game entities

PostScenario: should fail if scenario already exists

retrieve_special_event: is broken due to angularization

PostGameMeta: don't crash when player names are null or missing
