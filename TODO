make it possible to filter out scenarios that use a role
from new printing of base game

make new edition the default

pick_game: show how many results are recorded for each scenario

params: replace player_count drop down with four separate
buttons

Result entities:
 * require game_id to be provided
 * refactor to be children of Game entities

PostScenario:
 * should fail if scenario already exists
 * enforce scenario_id equal SHA-1 hash of scenario data
 * use scenario entity attribute to indicate "daily" scenarios
 * include "daily" labels in /s/scenarios index.

join_network_game:
  Go Back button doesn't work

watch game: on some pages (e.g. forecast), gives users buttons to
rearrange cards

watch game: can we make a way to simply mirror what the controller
is doing? (e.g. if the controller clicks 'play special event', the
watcher will see the list of special events)

usability: text is a bit smaller than it needs to be on nexus 5/5x
browser

tournament events: always list in alphabetical order

tournament events: allow deleting

player_setup: provide way to switch to an equaivalent scenario with
  a different player count. Ideas:
   - keep infection deck the same
   - keep position of epidemics and special events same in draw pile
   - other cards are shuffled
   - track scenario equivalencies as a scenario attribute

Testing:
 * new assigment special event
 * resilient population special event
 * infection rumor special event
